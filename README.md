Trunkless is a spiritual successor to [prosaic](https://github.com/vilmibm/prosaic).

This repository contains code for:

- processing source material
- inserting cutup phrases into `postgresql`
- hosting a web front-end

If you are very brave you can run Trunkless yourself; otherwise, check out the version [I host](https://trunkless.tilde.town).
